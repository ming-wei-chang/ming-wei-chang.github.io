## News

### AI Textbook

I am really honored to help write the Chapter 24 in the fourth edition of the Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach [link](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/ack.html)

## Selected Projects ([Publication List (Google Scholar)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GiCqMFkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao))

Here are some fun projects I have worked on with many awesome researchers and students.

### **BERT**. [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)

BERT is a framework for pre-training deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text. BERT achieves state-of-the-art results for 11 nlp tasks when it was published.
(NAACL 2019 best paper)

### Zero-shot entity linking. [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07348)

The power of text understanding makes zero-shot entity linking finally possible. (ACL 2019 best paper candidate)

### Semantic parsing for knownledge base. [paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/semantic-parsing-via-staged-query-graph-generation-question-answering-with-knowledge-base/)

By applying an advanced entity linking [system](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08075) and a deep convolutional neural network model, this semantic parsing system outperformed previous methods substantially when it was published. (ACL 2015 outstanding paper)

### Semantic parsing using weak supervision. [paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W10-2903.pdf)

This project shows that learning with a weak feedback signal is capable of producing strong semantic parsers. This was very surprisingly to me at that time.

### Load forecasting using SVM. [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1350819/)

My first (or second?) research project (in 2001!) under the supervision of [Chih-Jen Lin](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/). In this project, we use SVM to predict the power needed to balance the supply and load for powerplants. Winner of the EUNITE competition 2001.
